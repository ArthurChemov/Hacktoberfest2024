# Data Processing Scripts

This folder contains scripts used for processing and analyzing data. Follow the instructions below to get started with the scripts.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

To run the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** or another relevant language (update depending on the language you're using)
- Any required libraries or dependencies (see the requirements section)

### 2. Installation

If there are specific dependencies, you should install them using a package manager. For example, if you're using Python, you can include instructions to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

If no requirements.txt is present, manually install necessary dependencies. Example for Python:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

N.B - Replace pandas and numpy with the actual dependencies your scripts require.


### 3. Running the Scripts

Each script in this folder has a specific purpose. Below are examples of how to run the scripts. Make sure to run these commands from the /scripts directory or specify the full path if running from the project root.

**Preprocessing Data**: 
This script cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```
    **Analyzing Data**: 
    This script performs the main analysis on the cleaned data.

```bash
python analyze_data.py
```
    **Generating Reports**: 
    After analyzing data, you can generate reports or summaries using the following script:

```bash
python generate_report.py
```
### 4. Input and Output Data

**Input Data**: 
The scripts will read input data from the /data folder, so ensure your raw data files are stored there (e.g., /data/raw_data.csv).

**Output Data**: 
Any processed data or reports generated by the scripts will be stored in the /data folder (e.g., /data/processed_data.csv, /data/summary_report.xlsx).

### 5. Script Descriptions

Below is a list of the scripts in this folder and their purpose:

**preprocess_data.py**: 
A Python script for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. This includes handling missing values, filtering outliers, and preparing data for analysis.

**analyze_data.py**: 
This script performs the main data analysis, such as calculating statistical measures, generating visualizations, or performing machine learning tasks (update as necessary).

**generate_report.py**: 
This script generates a final report or summary after the analysis is complete, possibly saving the output as a CSV, PDF, or Excel file.

### 6. Adding New Scripts

If you need to add new data processing scripts, ensure you:

- Place them in this /scripts folder.
- Update the README with a brief description of the new script's functionality.

### 7. Example Usage

**Preprocess Data**:

```bash
python preprocess_data.py --input ../data/raw_data.csv --output ../data/cleaned_data.csv
```
**Analyze Data**:

```bash
python analyze_data.py --input ../data/cleaned_data.csv --output ../data/analysis_results.csv
```
This allows flexibility in specifying input and output file paths.

### 8. Additional Notes

- Ensure that all dependencies and scripts are compatible with your system's environment.
- Adjust file paths as necessary depending on where the data is stored in the project.

For more detailed information on each script or if you encounter issues, refer to the inline comments in the respective script files or contact the project maintainers.

### Customization Options:
- **Dependencies**: In the "Installation" section, update the dependencies if your project uses specific libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.). If you're using another language like JavaScript, update accordingly.
- **Script Descriptions**: Make sure the descriptions for each script (like `preprocess_data.py`, `analyze_data.py`, etc.) match what your scripts actually do.
- **Example Commands**: Customize the example commands based on how your scripts accept input and output paths or any other parameters they require.

### Steps to Add the README:
1. Create the `README.md` file in the `/scripts` folder.
2. Copy and paste the above content into the file.
3. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add scripts/README.md
   git commit -m "Added README for data processing folder"
   git push
