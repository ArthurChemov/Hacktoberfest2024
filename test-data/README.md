# Test Data

This folder contains sample JSON and CSV files for testing purposes.

- `sample.json`: A sample file representing user data in JSON format.
- `sample.csv`: A sample file representing the same user data in CSV format.

Contributors can use these files to test scripts that handle data processing, API requests, or other features that involve working with JSON or CSV files.
