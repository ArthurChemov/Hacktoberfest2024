# Data Parsing Utilities

This folder is designated for utilities focused on data parsing tasks. 

## Overview

The `data-parsing` folder will contain scripts and tools designed to process and analyze various data formats. These utilities will aim to simplify the handling of data, making it easier to extract, transform, and load (ETL) information from different sources.

## Future Development

As the project evolves, the following types of utilities may be added to this folder:

- **Data Extraction Scripts**: Tools to extract data from APIs, databases, or files.
- **Data Transformation Tools**: Scripts that manipulate and convert data into desired formats.
- **Data Validation Utilities**: Tools to ensure data integrity and correctness.

Stay tuned for updates as we expand the capabilities of this folder!
