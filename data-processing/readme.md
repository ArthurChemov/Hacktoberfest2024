# Data Cleaner

## Overview

This Python script processes datasets (CSV or Excel files) by cleaning missing data, removing duplicates, and normalizing formats. It can be extended with additional features like support for more file types, data visualization, and optimized performance for large datasets.

## Features

- Handle missing data by filling with mean, median, or dropping rows (only for numeric columns).
- Remove duplicate rows.
- Normalize numeric data and date formats.
- Support for both CSV and Excel files.
- Save cleaned data to a new file.

## Ideal Contributions

- Add support for more file types (e.g., JSON, SQL databases).
- Integrate data visualization for summaries (e.g., missing data charts).
- Improve performance when dealing with larger datasets.

## How to Use

1. Place your data file (CSV or Excel) in the appropriate location.
2. Edit the file path in the script (`data_cleaner.py`) to point to your dataset.
3. Run the script:

  python data_cleaner.py

## Example Usage

python data_cleaner.py C:/path/to/your/file.csv
